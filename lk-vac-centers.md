## Structured Data

https://www.presidentsoffice.gov.lk/index.php/vaccination-dashboard/ points to a list of COVID19 vaccination centers open in Sri Lanka, on a given day. While the list is official and up-to-date, it is a PDF shared on Google Drive (hence unstructured), and is available (as of writing), only in English.

We have scraped this data source, parsed the data, and shared it in several structured formats. This document describes this structured data in more detail.
